Who → What → Why → How → When
==============================

1. WHO (Users / Stakeholders)
------------------------------
- Dubber: Works on assigned clips to create dubbed audio.
- QA: Reviews and approves/rejects dubbed clips with feedback.
- Manager: Creates projects, assigns tasks, monitors progress.
- Studio Admins: Interested in timely, quality-assured delivery with reporting and control.

2. WHAT (Key Features & Capabilities)
-------------------------------------
For Manager:
- Create dubbing projects with file uploads and language targets.
- Break files into clips, assign tasks manually or automatically.
- Configure due dates, QA count needed, and time ranges.
- View dashboards for project status, metrics (e.g., time to completion, iterations).

For Dubber:
- Access task dashboard with assigned clips and statuses.
- Use dubbing editor (e.g., 11Labs) to dub and clone voice.
- Submit partial clips for QA review.
- View and respond to QA comments.
- Receive real-time notifications on task updates.

For QA:
- Access clips submitted for review.
- Add timestamped comments, approve/reject clips.
- Approve entire tasks once satisfied.
- Work independently or in parallel with other QAs.
- Get notified on new submissions or comments.

3. WHY (Problems / Goals)
--------------------------
- Studios need scalable and quality-assured dubbing workflows.
- Manual task assignment and QA feedback loops are inefficient and slow.
- Collaboration between dubbers and QA is fragmented in current tools.
- Project delays occur when dubbers are unavailable or QA reviews conflict.

4. HOW (Design / Architecture / Workflow)
-----------------------------------------
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures the right permissions for each user type.
- Project creation wizard allows managers to define clips, timelines, and assignments.
- Dashboards with filters help managers track progress and identify delays.
- Dubbers can submit clips partially for faster QA feedback cycles.
- QA dashboard supports independent reviews; comments and decisions are tracked.
- Conflict resolution: conflicting QA reviews flagged for manager intervention.
- Dubber unavailability handled via reassignment workflows and progress preservation.
- In-app notifications and version tracking enhance collaboration and accountability.

5. WHEN (Workflow Timing / Feature Use)
----------------------------------------
- Manager sets up project → assigns clips to dubbers and QA → dubbing begins.
- Dubbers submit clips partially → QAs begin reviewing in parallel.
- QA reviews may conflict → flagged for discussion or manager override.
- If dubber becomes unavailable → system alerts manager → clips can be reassigned.
- Project progresses with notifications at each key event (submission, review, rework).
