1. What if a dubber is unavailable mid-project?
==============================================

🔥 Problem:
Dubbers may become unavailable due to illness, bandwidth issues, or leaving the studio — risking project delays and team bottlenecks.

✅ Design Ideas:

a. Dubber Availability Status
- Each dubber can set their availability (Available / Unavailable).
- Managers can also mark dubbers unavailable if informed externally.
- Tasks can be auto-flagged if assigned to an unavailable dubber.

b. Auto-Reassignment Logic
- If a dubber is unavailable for more than X hours/days:
  - Manager gets notified: “Dubber A is unavailable; do you want to reassign their 3 incomplete clips?”
  - Manager can manually or auto-reassign unstarted or WIP clips.
  - Work already completed by the dubber is preserved and attributed correctly.

c. Collaborative Editing Mode (Optional enhancement)
- Allow another dubber to “take over” the task collaboratively (like Google Docs), especially in tight deadlines.
- Lock editing to avoid race conditions; show who’s currently working.

d. Version & Progress Preservation
- Keep history of previous work done by the dubber.
- Let new dubber pick up where the last one left off (reuse dubs, comments, etc.).

e. Analytics Alert
- In dashboards: highlight stuck tasks or incomplete clips with overdue status and reason like “Dubber unavailable”.



2. How to handle conflicting QA reviews?
========================================

🔥 Problem:
Multiple QAs may disagree on tone, timing, or lip-sync quality of a clip. Conflicts need resolution before final approval.

✅ Design Ideas:

a. Independent QA Reviews + Aggregation
- Let each QA submit their review independently.
- System aggregates:
  - If all approve → auto-approved
  - If any reject → moves to “conflict” state

b. QA Consensus Workflow
- For conflicting reviews:
  - Alert manager or senior QA: “Clip has conflicting reviews from QA1 and QA2”
  - Present side-by-side QA comments
  - Allow resolution through:
    - Discussion (threaded comments)
    - Manager override (Final call)
    - Request rework from dubber (reset state)

c. Confidence Voting or Tiebreakers (Advanced)
- Use weighted voting (e.g., senior QAs count more)
- Or use a rotating “Lead QA” who resolves conflicts
- Or escalate to manager if more than one conflict occurs on a clip

d. Collaborative QA Panel View
- Show all QA decisions and comments in a unified thread
- Allow tagging: “@QA2, what do you think about the timing here?”
- Promote transparency and peer discussion

e. Audit Trail
- Keep detailed logs of:
  - Who reviewed
  - Who overrode
  - When and why decisions were made (comment required for override)
